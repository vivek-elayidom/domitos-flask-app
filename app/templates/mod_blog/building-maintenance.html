                        <p> Building maintenance applies to all the activities required to maintain a working and liveable house. A single building requires a skilled team of multiple people in areas such as electrical , plumbing and HVAC, with different
                            maintenance specialties. Without routine maintenance services, a building can easily become an unfriendly living and working place and thus maintenance technicians are invaluable. If you're looking to become a repair technician
                            yourself one day or just being curious about what building maintenance is all about, we 're going to break down everything you need to know. </p>
                        <h2 class="blog">What is Building Maintenance?</h2>
                        <p> Building maintenance encompasses a variety of tasks that help the tenants of a building create a safe and comfortable work or living environment. From anything inside a building, such as bathroom cleaning and the maintenance of
                            electrical systems, to anything outside a building, such as lawn care and landscaping, routine maintenance services are performed to keep properties in tip-top form. Maintenance teams are usually split into various roles, depending
                            on similar maintenance services. Usually this structure looks just like:</p>

                        <p> <strong>Janitorial</strong> : Typical daily tasks involve cleaning the house, mopping the floors, emptying the garbage, cleaning the bathrooms. </p>

                        <img src="/static/img/blog/building-maintenance/janitorial-services-min2.jpg" width="600" height=auto>


                        <p><strong>Maintenance engineer</strong>: Responsible for routine maintenance and repair of building equipment including HVAC, electrical and plumbing.

                        </svg>
                        <p><strong>Maintenance Supervisor</strong>: Responsible for the timeline and delegation of tasks to be completed for overall maintenance of the building. Maintenance supervisors are also responsible for personnel management including
                            recruitment and reviews.
                        </p>

                        <p>Building maintenance requires a wide variety of activities depending on the company or organization in question. It involves a lot of "behind the scenes" work to keep a facility or building running and comfortable for its users.
                            Maintenance of buildings involves cleaning common areas, periodically removing garbage and fixing damaged objects. It can include inspection, repair and maintenance of electrical systems, heating and air conditioning systems,
                            as well as other utilities. House maintenance also applies in some cases to the outdoor properties and includes sprinkler control, lawn care, and landscape control.</p>
                        <h2 class="blog">Why Building Maintenance is Important?</h2>

                        <img src="/static/img/blog/building-maintenance/why-building-maintenance-is-important.jpg" width="600" height=auto>
                        <p> Building maintenance is important as it ensures the safety and comfort of anyone staying in a building, whether they live or work there. From a business perspective, proper regular maintenance can save property owners money in
                            the long run and contribute to a higher value of the property.</p>
                        <h2 class="blog">1- Keeps occupants safe </h2>
                        <p>A poorly maintained building can pose hazards to those who work or live there. Constant maintenance helps to avoid dangerous conditions, whether it is peeling paint, an unstable walkway, or inadequate air circulation. To ensure
                            this, security codes were created from organizations such as the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Upholding these codes and completing ongoing general
                            safekeeping procedures will avoid significant health hazards and unsafe work and living environments.</p>
                        <h2 class="blog">2- End up saving Money </h2>
                        <p>Precaution is more cost-effective than a cure, which is another reason why maintenance services are critical for building. An immediate repair or replacement of a large network would be more expensive than ongoing routine maintenance.
                            This is often easier to establish a budget for routine maintenance of building infrastructure than a repair or replacement that is unpredictable. </p>
                        <p>A maintenance service team can not only save money over time but also add to the overall value of the house. With a well-maintained, up-to-code building there's more interest that might mean more sales opportunities from selling,
                            renting, or leasing spaces.</p>
                        <h2 class="blog">The objectives of building maintenance works are:</h2>

                        <ol class="number-list">
                            <li>Maintenance of equipment, structures and facilities in good working order</li>
                            <li>Restoring it to original quality</li>
                            <li>Upgrading the facilities according to the progress of the building technologies.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>All the buildings deteriorate from the moment they are finished. Degradation intensity depends upon a variety of factors. The building's inhabitants can't control all the variables.</p>
                        <p>The following points shall be kept in mind during the design and development stages: </p>
                        <div class="row">

                            <img src="/static/img/blog/building-maintenance/building-construction-tips.jpg" width="800">

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <ol class="roman-list">
                                <li>Proper choice of materials for the building</li>
                                <li>Choosing appropriate construction techniques</li>
                                <li>Adequate construction and installation specifications</li>
                                <li>Effective monitoring during construction and rectification of defects before final certification.</li>
                                <li>Provision of sufficient space for properly designed landscaping</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>

                            <p>Depending on the nature of the construction, the building shall be sustained for an initial duration of 3 to 6 months immediately after the date of completion because there may be teething problems with any new building. If
                                these are taken care of, the stress of maintenance will be reduced. The maintenance cost increases disproportionately to a higher level when there are any inherent defects in both design and construction and the expected
                                building life is reduced. Building maintenance aims at an efficient and economical method of keeping the building and services fully usable. It requires various skills as affected by a building's occupancy and planned level
                                of efficiency. Planning the works to be performed to keep the building in good condition requires high skills. Maintenance suggestions can also be a continuous method for optimizing the design and development phases.</p>
                            <h2 class="blog">Example of building maintenance </h2>
                            <p>A department for building maintenance handles all of the systems, repairs and ongoing tasks to keep a facility running every day. Often, other company employees take for granted much of the work of the maintenance team. They
                                simply expect the building to be kept clean, the snow to be removed in the winter and the air conditioning to be on in the summer heat. An apartment complex is one example of a business that has varying maintenance needs
                                for buildings. Management requires regular property lawn and landscape care, and cleaning and repair units as residents move in and out. The residents themselves initiate work orders with requests for repair of appliances
                                or problems with pest control. Popular areas too need to be washed. </p>
                            <h2 class="blog">The people behind everything </h2>
                            <p>A team of highly skilled maintenance technicians stands behind every properly maintained building. A successful technician in many fields including HVAC, electrical , and plumbing is well-trained, diligent, flexible, and detail-oriented.
                            </p>
                            <p>In particular, the maintenance technicians: </p>

                            <p>Have you ever heard of the popular saying that prevention is better than cure, avoid the harm or later regret it? </p>
                            <ol class="number-list">

                                <li>External exposure to your building due to the rain-like natural environment, beating hot sun and wind. These natural elements cause a weathering of the building over a certain period of time. Maintaining the building avoids
                                    quick deterioration of the structure and makes it long-lasting. </li>
                                <li>Proper building maintenance also involves daily building inspection that helps to locate the damaged items, so that they can be repaired on time.</li>
                                <li>The building's dilapidation and sporadic maintenance leads to a loosening of doors, spalled walls and concrete floors that certainly isn't healthy for anyone.</li>

                            <ol class="number-list">
                                <li><strong>Save your money:</strong> Precaution is always easy and cost-effective over cure. It is very natural that the cost of emergency repairs is higher than the periodic maintenance. Periodic and regular building maintenance
                                    ensures that the building is well maintained and fully free from destruction, expensive problems and the constant urgent need for repairs. </li>
                                <li><strong>Limits the dangers:</strong> A bad atmosphere often characterizes damaged and badly managed houses. The damaged building, parking lots, walkways and other premises may increase somebody's hazards and liabilities
                                    due to damage to your building.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Managing Expenses:</strong> It is easier to schedule periodic repairs at regular intervals, while emergencies may result in a budget issue. Emergencies can result in heavy and unpredictable costs. Maintaining the
                                    building helps you to set up an emergency repair fund to keep it cost-effective, reliable and appropriate with simple maintenance costs. </li>
                                <li><strong>Improves User Experience:</strong> Impressions can usually be hard to modify. A properly maintained building reflects good administration, professionalism and a positive attitude towards your premises. It sends
                                    a positive message about any deal while a building that is dirty or poorly maintained can trigger a negative impression. A well-kept, gleaming building is always appreciable.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Day-to-day maintenance:</strong> It is extremely important to maintain the basic infrastructure and the building's architecture. These companies inspect the building regularly and carry out repair work if necessary.
                                        They are also responsible for such activities as lift maintenance, window cleaning, building painting, ceiling repair and care, doors and windows, and much more.

                                    <li><strong>Electrical Maintenance: </strong> A building should have adequate electrical fittings and, if there is a loose wire or other uncovered gadget, these companies providing construction maintenance services immediately
                                        take action and repair it. They make sure to review and test all the fittings and equipment to prevent any incidents.

                                        or too warm a room gives the people sitting in the room a little discomfort. A facility management company makes sure that the temperature is adjusted according to the weather and that the working conditions are
                                        perfect. They also keep a regular check of the heating and air conditioning arrangements and service or repair the parts when necessary

                                <p> Maintenance is commonly viewed by building owners as a sunk expense. Capital is spent on urgent issues and as buildings mature this is a costly task. If maintenance does not become a priority, our building teams will get
                                    overworked with reactive tasks, money will be lost to decreased energy efficiency and premature replacement of building assets. We have the ability to manage maintenance as building managers in order to optimize the
                                    value of our facilities and increase company revenues. Enjoying occupants with well-managed buildings and prioritizing proactive construction management can actually pay dividends in our ability to avoid expensive repairs.
                                    Use the following three strategies to optimize your organisation's building management and reduce maintenance costs. </p>
                                <h2 class="blog">How To Reduce Costs to Build Maintenance</h2>
                                <ol class="number-list">
                                    <li> <strong>Maintenance Request Response Time:</strong> Shortened reactive maintenance response time is an opportunity to demonstrate world class customer service any time something goes wrong in your house. Delighting
                                        the occupants of buildings gives them a reason to promote your company. React to maintenance requests promptly and make customer support a priority. There are a variety of ways you can a the response times for maintenance
                                        requests. The first is simple: move from paper-based work order systems or spreadsheets to a management system for the facility. Next then? Be sure that you have up-to-date floor plans for each of your facilities
                                        so that each of your repair technicians know exactly where to go when responding to requests for service rather than running back and forth between your shop and the work order venue. </li>
                                    <li> <strong>Automate Preventive Maintenance :</strong> Regardless of urgency, proactive maintenance frequently takes a back seat to reactive problems. Ultimately though, due to a lack of time and money, we are not getting
                                        around to completing all of the maintenance projects for our buildings. We spend a lot of our days inputting data, reacting to immediate tasks and looking for information instead of actually solving issues. Lack
                                        of exposure to this information is the greatest contributor to building management inefficiency today, and that is what causes us to end up in the reactive maintenance loop right back in time. Through accessing
                                        the building details you need and setting up proactive maintenance cycles in a facilities management app, you 're going to be one step ahead of your preparation and you're going to be even closer to saving time
                                        and money.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Utilize a Facility Software for Onboarding :</strong> Training and onboarding of new facilities and repair staff can be one of the greatest drains on the budget. Allocating extra staff to new employees can be
                                        difficult to ensure they learn the ropes during their first few months on the job. If your team uses a software for facility management , especially a software that has asset mapping and digitized floor plans, your
                                        new employees can easily learn the ins and outs and routes of your facility. Your app can also save loads of time by searching for important details, such as any maintenance records, asset O&M manuals, or special
                                        notes made by your team. New employee preparation can be cut from months to weeks with the right facility software, and save the department hundreds of extra dollars in the operating budget. </li>

                                <h2 class="blog">The Risks Of Poor Building Maintenance</h2>
                                <img src="/static/img/blog/building-maintenance/bad-maintenance-compressed.jpg">
                                <p> Weak or inadequate management of the buildings will in many ways create risks for providers of early years. Poorly maintained buildings can be dangerous and inherently unhealthy, particularly for small children. Problems
                                    such as humidity and cold caused by drafts and inefficient heating systems can cause accidents and injuries to children and neglected safety features, such as tendency to slip and travel hazards or electrical safety.
                                    Furthermore, the neglect of items like windows and doors can increase the risk of security breaches. Services such as electrical and water systems present many hazards if not maintained properly. Poorly maintained electrical
                                    systems can increase the risk of fires and electrocution and poorly maintained water systems can give rise to problems. </p>
                                <p>Bad maintenance of buildings, however, not only affects health but can also add a range of costs on an organization. </p>
                                <p>Preservation of the premises is an important factor in the efficient and cost-effective running of the buildings. Faults in a building's fabric, for example, particularly in older buildings, can worsen quickly and cause
                                    the building to deteriorate. Leaks and humidity are well known and evident defects which can cause long-term damage. Faults like dripping taps, ineffective insulation, cracked windows, unserviced boilers, broken radiator
                                    thermostats, missing roof slates and leaky gutters can all also lead to costly repairs. In addition to the building fabric, services such as water, lighting, heating and air-conditioning systems also need to be maintained
                                    to ensure the building is safe and user-friendly, and to ensure that energy is not wasted. In this context there is a direct link between poor maintenance and higher energy costs. Poorly maintained and poorly insulated
                                    buildings are difficult to keep warm, and the cost of heating can spiral.</p>

                                        to create environments that facilitate visitors and everyday users' intended and naturally occurring behaviours. Thus architects create spaces that allow people to perform daily tasks and a range of daily social
                                        activities. However, architects also play a vital role in securing future maintenance of newly designed buildings to ensure these physical spaces continue to exist. </p>

                                        of being indoors and outdoors. These architectural landmarks' uncompromising aesthetics rely on vast open spaces which allow the dominance of air and natural light, creating pleasant and spectacular environments.
                                        Nevertheless, the continuous use of these buildings gives rise to a number of practical issues about the maintenance of the buildings. Permanent ceiling and wall installations require significant architectural sacrifices
                                        and lack versatility to perform specific maintenance tasks. Scaffolding provides the necessary flexibility but is a laborious and time-consuming solution for performing daily maintenance projects such as cleaning,
                                        repairing and decorating.

                                    <p> Flexible construction maintenance solutions open up a range of possibilities for architects to ensure future facility management can be conducted in ways that are in line with the building's architectural visions.</p>
                                    <h2 class="blog">Sustainability Necessitates Maintenance</h2>
                                    <p> By considering the maintenance possibilities during the design process, architects play a critical role in ensuring that completed designs are properly conserved. Additionally, by emphasizing these possibilities, architects
                                        who are familiar with modular maintenance technology can grant themselves those design freedoms. Sustainable architectural design needs to provide flexible, safe and economically sound thinking solutions for future
                                        building maintenance.
