                        <p>When buildings are more technologically sophisticated, architects and clients are seeking more from the key contractors and subcontractors in terms of their operational and maintenance manuals. A higher level of detail and better
                            quality of information is required to ensure that the highest level of facility /building management is achieved even after construction. O&M Manuals are not only an integral part of the handover of buildings, but are also
                            a legal obligation to comply with the 2007 CDM Regulations. With the significant increase in 'Green Construction' in recent years, O&M manuals also need to comply with BREEAM and LEED requirements in the industry. The benefit
                            of having a quality and detailed O&M Manual is not only for the end user, but also for the contractors who submit the information. A U.S. study has shown that 65 to 85 % of the cost of a new building is post-construction: if
                            the cost falls within the defect or warranty liability period, the cost may be transferred back to the installation contractor. Proper support of system activities is an integral part of maintaining consistent, ongoing operations.
                            Information supporting operational activities can come from any number of sources, each with specific agendas but consistent in their common support of operational continuity. The challenge for operational managers is to effectively
                            unite and communicate this information in a way that accommodates the day-to-day operating environment. One approach commonly used is the creation and distribution of Operations and Maintenance Manuals. Before crawling deep
                            into it, we have to know what is Operations and Maintenance Manual. An Operation and Maintenance Manual (O&M manual) is a common term for a set of comprehensive procedures that federal pipeline safety regulations require pipeline
                            operators to develop and implement.Procedures in the O&M Manual should cover pipeline operation , maintenance and response to abnormal events and emergencies. Or simply we can say a document describing the operation and maintenance
                            procedures required of an entity or system. The Operations and Maintenance Manuals, as part of the Health and Safety Initiative, are intended to provide a detailed source of knowledge that guides the contractor and end users
                            in their understanding of the building. The manual will describe the design of the building and its structures, as well as the processes and procedures necessary for its operation and maintenance in a secure and safe manner.

                            <strong>Who can prepare O&M Manual? </strong>A designer who has the experience in the production of the manuals is allowed to work on the management, coordination and production of the manuals from start to finish. They will
                            work with the design and construction teams to ensure that a manual of the highest quality with the correct and required material is created. This would meet the needs of end-users and ensure that the contractual and professional
                            responsibilities of our clients are discharged to the Employer in good time. Building owner's O&M manual The Building Owner's Manual or Operations and Maintenance Manual (O&M Manual) contains the information required for the
                            operation , maintenance, decommissioning and demolition of the building. The building owner's manual shall be prepared by the contractor or subcontractor with additional information from the designers and suppliers. It is a
                            requirement that is generally defined in the preliminary documents section of the tender document, where its contents will be described, although there may be additional requirements for mechanical and electrical services in
                            the mechanical and electrical specification. The client should be provided with a draft version of the document as part of the handover procedure prior to the certification of practical completion. The final document is typically
                            not published in full form until several months after functional completion, as commissioning information also needs to include summer and winter readings in the fully occupied house. Preliminary documents may include a number
                            of copies of the building owner's manual and may include an online edition.

                        <p> The contents of the O&M manual for inclusion in the final documentation may seem confusing, as the term has a broad meaning for all project transfer documentation. However, one thing is certain that the contents of the O and M
                            manual are substantially more than a few ring binders of information thrown together. In short, the O&M manual AKA "Operation and Maintenance Manual" (O&M Manual) is a file containing all the information required for the operation
                            , maintenance, decommissioning and demolition of a building or structure. Nowadays, the O and M manual is usually produced using a cloud-based software solution as part of a construction project software rather than a manual
                            hard copy process. The manual is unique to each area of the project, from hardware, electrical , plumbing, gas, etc. Each manual shall be prepared by either the manufacturer, the subcontractors, the service engineers and the
                            other contracted suppliers. The contents of the O and M Manual is a requirement that has been defined as part of the tender documentation where its contents are outlined. This can be subdivided into parts or even stand-alone
                            manuals covering machinery, mechanical and electrical installation services in the mechanical and electrical specification section.</p>
                        <p>
                            An electronic soft copy or draft version of the contents of the O and M manual would normally be provided to the client as part of the handover procedure prior to any final sign-offs for completion. The final manual will then be created online for reviews,
                            edits and updates so that authorized staff can access it 24/7 or print it to a hard copy for distribution. Preliminary documents in the tender or contract contracts that include a number of copies of the O&M manual, so that
                            electronic versions are recommended to avoid being too labour-intensive.</p>

                        <p>The challenge in creating O&M Manual contents is that while most of this information is likely to exist, it is intended to simplify the preparation, compilation and assembly of its various components. Also, as updates and revisions
                            are a normal function within the industry, the use of software avoids any delays or out-of-date versions. Another smart idea is to use the O and M Manual models to reduce manual rework. That over the life of the building or
                            structure, the manual must adapt to reflect the changes that have taken place in the building, its equipment or systems, along with records of all maintenance that has taken place. In conclusion , the objective of the O and
                            M Manual is to optimize the functioning of buildings and their equipment with clear documentation on maintenance guidelines, specifications, warranties, inspections, approvals and sign-offs for the proactive management of their
                            operation.

                        <p>O&M Manual planning is one component of a much broader knowledge transfer process. Transferring knowledge is necessary to facilitate the transition of the projects product from the project stage into continuing operations. An O&M
                            Manual contains information and strategies designed to guide operational stakeholders in the normal use and maintenance of the projects product. The manual should be written in such a way as to encourage actions and responses
                            to anything that can arise during normal product operations and maintenance. The actual type of manuals produced, the information they contain, and the defined stakeholder responses are derived from information inputs from
                            areas such as: </p>
                        <p>
                            Project Team O&M Manuals help transfer knowledge, lessons learned from product development and testing, from the Project Team to the Operations Team. Operations Support Environment O&M Manuals document the operational processes, tasks and responsibilities
                            associated with ongoing operations and maintenance in the production environment; </p>
                        <p> Operations Activities O&M Manuals save time and cost by reducing the misuse of common operating activities by the use of descriptive, recorded, step-by - step instructions.</p>
                        <p> Operations Education O&M Manuals can be used as teaching tools; encouraging stakeholders to make simple system operations and maintenance decisions that may otherwise be mishandled;

                        <p>Every O&M Manual is uniquely designed to meet the particular needs of its mission. It is not uncommon, particularly for large complex structures, for multiple manuals to be created for different divisions, work functions, activities,
                            etc. Some common types of O&M Manuals are:

                        <p>The task of producing a convenient service and maintenance manual is to make it detailed without being dull. Put some thought into preparing the manual so that it can really have an effect on the bottom line in the long run with
                            improved productivity and organization. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p> <strong>Choose the platform</strong> : With today's technology, you should be able to find a portal that allows you to continue updating and changing your operating and maintenance manual as required. Printed manuals or
                                    even those written in word processing documents are very difficult to update. You also run the risk of outdated manuals floating around the organisation.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Create a consistent and easy-to - read template</strong> : You 're going to want your manual to be easy to scan, and you're going to want your employees to be able to locate the required sections quickly. By ensuring
                                    consistency across the board, you will make the manual more valuable to all its users.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Involve managers in the production of manuals</strong>: Ask the front-line supervisors for feedback as they actually build the intestines of the service and maintenance manual. You are the ones who ask questions
                                    and see inefficiencies and mistakes and you want to understand what you think is the most important way to communicate. If they are interested in the production of the manual, they will be more engaged and help to encourage
                                    its use and enhancement.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Encourage feedback and improvements</strong>: Be sure to ask for feedback, especially in the early days of manual use. As employees turn to this resource, they will have further questions or suggestions. Provide
                                    a program in place to study and incorporate the best recommendations to make the operations and maintenance manual more useful over time.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Operation and maintenance manuals can be a valuable resource for your entire maintenance team. Invest the time to put one together if your organization does not already have one. Note that you can upload it to your maintenance
                            program to make it easier to use.</p>
                        <p>Creating an O and M Building Manual prototype When you're nearing the end of a construction project, you need to think about creating an Operation and Maintenance Manual (O and M) for asset transfer. Failure to provide complete
                            documentation could delay the successful completion of the construction project. So, leaving the compilation of the O and M manual until the last minute can have big consequences. Collecting details during the project makes
                            the process simpler for everyone. Plan ahead for the building handover so that all is well organized for the day of handover. This makes it a smooth , easy process, and avoids disputes and damage to reputation.

                        <p>Everything used and installed in a building project comes with information from the manufacturer. This will include requirements, warranties, and details on service and maintenance. It makes sense to give it to the new owner.</p>

                            and M compliant, professional digital or cloud-based manuals. You can also recruit someone to do it for you. Paper-based documents are quickly becoming redundant in today's world. Apart from the waste and costs of paper documents,
                            digital technology has come a long way. Using a digital platform makes compiling a manual super quick. </p>

                        <p>The use of technology over traditional paper manuals facilitates accessibility, makes it easier to update information and offers more functionality. The Digital O&M Manual is an online building management system that integrates
                            all information (from O&M manuals, H&S files, drawings, etc.) into one convenient location. It has been designed for intuitive use by all parties and is as simple as possible to prevent incompatibility issues with mobile phones,
                            browsers, etc. and serves as a useful tool for clients. The Digital O&M Manual can be used as a collaborative tool for all subcontractors to upload all required handover information, which is essential for smooth handover and
                            successful post-handover construction. </p>

                        <p> The main aim of O&M Manual is to act as a reliable source of knowledge for the owner / customer after the completion of the project.They will refer back to it when they need information about the operation of any equipment or ordering
                            material. It outlines the construction of the building and all its systems, as well as the procedures for the operation and maintenance of the facility. All of this knowledge will allow the owner / customer to feel the need
                            to call an electrician or another contractor for permission. This includes all submitted for the project, including equipment, lighting, appliances, generators, fire alarm, protection, and more. All of these items were sent
                            to the owner who then approved the materials and equipment to be ordered, including color combinations, types and styles. The manual also contains warranty letters and inspection certificates for potential reference. Subcontractors
                            must also complete a manual for their applications, which is included in the final O&M manual. As-built sketches are eventually inserted as soon as the project is finished, displaying the final layout. The O&M is usually put
                            together by the Project Management Assistant, with the help of the Project Manager, near the completion of the project. Technically, this can be accomplished as long as all applications have been accepted and there are no modifications
                            to the content and equipment, but the modifications are unavoidable, and it is better to wait until the end of the project and that nothing is lost or has to be reworked.</p>

                        <p> The O&M manuals have a vital role to play as a reference source for the new Project Owner or Client. If well operated and maintained, the life of a building and its engineering services will exceed the service period. It is therefore
                            essential for the new owner or operator to quickly gain a clear understanding of the proper operational and maintenance needs involved. The design and delivery of a well-prepared O&M manual is therefore an integral part of
                            any construction service installation contract. A variety of variables can affect the final format of any O&M manual. The type of manual required must be adapted to meet the specific requirements of the project. However, the
                            format will also be influenced by the specific installation and categories of manual users involved. It is also important that the requirements of more than one level of reader need to be taken into account when compiling a
                            manual. Generally, O&M manual users fall into three broad categories: </p>

                        <ol class="roman-list">

                            <li>

                                    The different parts of the manual are likely to be addressed to these different categories of users, the contents should be subdivided and assembled to meet their needs. The non-technical owner / occupier of the building requires a very general overview
                                    of the systems installed and is therefore likely to refer only to those sections of the manual that will provide it;</p>

                                <p>Facility Operation & Maintenance Manual</p>
                                <p> It is now widely recognized that O&M represents the greatest cost of ownership and operation of the facility over its life cycle. The accuracy, relevance and timeliness of well-developed, user-friendly O&M manuals are becoming
                                    increasingly important. It is therefore becoming increasingly common for comprehensive, facility-specific O&M manuals to be prepared prior to commissioning. The objective is to support the facility's life-cycle effectively
                                    and efficiently by reducing unplanned shutdowns and allowing life-cycle savings. </p>

                        <p>As environmental design is an important part of every facility management strategy, the O&M Manual offers a way to minimize operational costs as part of a holistic maintenance program that includes a maintenance schedule. The O&M
                            Manual Content and Format Specifications are communicated by a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) customized to the needs of the Owner's Facility Management ( FM). This effort should be considered during the planning and
                            design phases and is usually carried out during the construction phase. Building Information Modeling ( BIM) and, in particular, COBie, introduced at the front end of the project, helps to facilitate the entire process.</p>
                        <p>
                            O&M manuals should be designed in a modular, building block format, to simplify the integration of new / additional data, such as adjustments in design / configuration, and to represent as-built conditions. The manual should be available no later than
                            the start-up / start-up facility. However, fast track programs can be 'front-end loaded' to meet immediate objectives; i.e. only that information needed to train personnel in preparation for start-up/commissioning systems can
                            be developed first. This can then be combined with the Owner 's overall O&M manual for completion and turnover within a defined timeframe. The use of the Start-up / Command Manual offers an important opportunity for its contents
                            to be checked against activated systems. The efforts of qualified professional authors , editors, developers, teachers, 3D modelers, illustrators and software specialists will ensure that the Owner receives detailed, site-specific
                            (as-built) and user-oriented documentation of the highest quality. Those chosen for the job will have the following capabilities: </p>
                        <p>Collect relevant data through interviews with personnel, engineers, equipment manufacturers / installers / integrators, etc., submissions, and on-site testing of installed systems / equipment and associated physical data collection</p>
                        <p>Review, analyze and assess the system-level facility using the engineering / technical data obtained. </p>
                        <p>Identify / develop procedures needed to achieve the most effective integration of systems. </p>
                        <p>Design the contents of the O&M Manual using terminology recognized by maintenance staff with general professional experience.</p>
                        <p>Provide a high level of trust to the staff of the Owner, e.g. through accurate content and user-friendly format</p>
                        <p> System-level O&M procedures do not replace the manufacturer's documentation for specific parts of equipment, but rather supplement those publications and guide their use. For example, system-level troubleshooting will fail-analyze
                            the component level, such as the pump, valve or engine, then refer to specific manufacturer 's requirements to remove / clean / inspect / repair / test or replace the component.</p>
                        <p> Training for new personnel is considered to be a vital component of operation and maintenance, especially when new equipment is installed or new technology is used. It is important for the overall facility management program that
                            the staff of the facilities be properly instructed and motivated. Training courses will inform staff about the procedures necessary to operate and maintain complex systems and equipment, often using the system-level O&M manual
                            as a basis for information. O&M manuals, which are equally suitable for use in training, can be provided both in paper and as an on-line interactive electronic manual (IEM) developed using web-based and other accepted applications
                            (html, xml, PDF, etc.). Training should be ongoing to keep pace with changes in the facility's technology and equipment.</p>
                        <p>O&M Manual and Health And Safety File</p>
                        <p> The O&M Manual and the Health and Safety File are two documents that you will need for most construction projects. Both documents are required upon completion of the project. These are two separate documents. Supplied together
                            sometimes, given separately sometimes. Both documents are required upon completion of the project. And, there may even be some overlap in the content. But these are two different documents, though. Supplied together sometimes,
                            given separately sometimes. Simply saying, the O&M manual provides information on the operation and maintenance of the building. The health and safety file includes details on the health and safety of the potential use and
                            maintenance of the house.</p>
                        <p> The O&M manual, or the Operation and Maintenance Manual, is a bit like the owner's manual that you get with your car. Except that it's for a building or a structure. Some people even call it the building owners' manual. It is not
                            a specific document on health and safety, but it may contain some information on health and safety. Or, of course, information that would help from a health and safety point of view. The obligation to include details on operation
                            and maintenance is typically included in the construction contract, particularly for larger projects. </p>
                        <p>Whereas the Health and Safety File is a document required by the Construction (Design & Management) Regulations (also known as the CDM). This document is legally mandated by the CDM, a set of health and safety regulations that
                            apply to any construction project. As the name suggests, the health and safety file is a folder that is unique to health and safety. Unlike the O&M Handbook, the health and safety file focuses on supplying information to the
                            customer. Data required for potential use, repairs, cleaning of buildings, and any possible projects. Unlike the O&M manual, the health and safety file only includes material related to health and safety.</p>
                        <p>Well, what are the differences?</p>
                        <p> There are four major differences in Operation and Maintenance Manual and Health and Safety File.</p>
                        <p>Legal Requirements: The health and safety file is required under the Construction (Design & Management) Regulations by law. The O&M manual is usually a requirement of the construction contract.</p>
                        <p>Information: The O&M Manual contains all information on the operation and maintenance of the building. The health and safety file only contains information relevant to health and safety.</p>
                        <p>Size: The health and safety file will typically be smaller as it focuses exclusively on health and safety. You don't need to include any of the instructions, plans, and certificates in the O&M book. It should only refer to specific
                            information on health and safety.</p>
                        <p>Use: These two documents are intended to serve two different purposes. If you need to know how to do something, or when to do it, look at the O&M manual. If you need to know if something is safe to do, or if there is a hazardous
                            material, look in the health and safety file.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> The differences between the O&M manual and the health and safety file are now evident. There are also some similarities and overlaps of information. If you need details in both papers, you don't need to repeat it. Information can
                            be cross-referenced when it is applicable to both documents.</p>
