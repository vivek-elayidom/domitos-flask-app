                        <p>The Internet of Things ( IoT) is a collection of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines equipped with unique identifiers and the ability to transmit data across a network without involving human-to-human
                            or computer-to-computer contact. Its potential excites multiple industries. The importance of IoT in the building is very vital. Modern building operations follow IoT to achieve energy savings, gain flexibility in operation,
                            and ease in day-to-day maintenance activities. It is now starting to have a positive impact on automation and control of smart buildings. IoT offers a number of benefits for building automation including lower energy consumptions,
                            improvements in operational efficiencies, predictive maintenance, improvements in financial planning, improvements in building performance data, and the increased use of sensors, among others.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            IOT inputs the required intelligence into the basic building blocks and it helps make it smart. An IoT implemented building can be addressed as a “SMART BUILDING” which can automate and control the building operations like fire and safety, security, air
                            conditioning, ventilation, etc. A smart building uses sensors and microchips to collect and manage data in accordance with the functions and services of a building. Such an infrastructure helps owners, operators, and facility
                            managers boost asset efficiency and performance, reducing energy consumption, maximizing how space is used, and minimizing buildings' environmental effects. The systems must be constructed so that maintenance and adjustments
                            can be performed.

                        <p>
                            In the simplest terms, the Internet of Things is a network of sensors, meters, appliances and other devices that are capable of sending and receiving data.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="mb-3">What IOT is not? </h4>
                        <p>There are multiple reasons why most of the buildings adopt IoT solutions. </p>
